 <h2>Learning support</h2>
 <P>The aim of the Governors and Staff with responsibility for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities is to help children with 
 learning difficulties to have a successful and rewarding time at Al-Helal Islamy Academi School & college.
</P>
<P>Our main thrust is to support children in classes where they find the work particularly challenging. But we do more than this. We hope that whether the problem is reading, spelling, handwriting, numeracy or something quite different, we will be able to offer help at the right time in the right place.
</P>
<P>The school has been modified to provide wheelchair access to all ground floor classrooms in the school buildings. All facilities are accessible and support is readily available from 8.30 am to 4.00 pm continuously. When a child with any form of learning difficulty comes to Northgate, our aim is for them to receive the help they need without being isolated from their friends. We hope that your childâ€™s happiness will prove our success.</P>
